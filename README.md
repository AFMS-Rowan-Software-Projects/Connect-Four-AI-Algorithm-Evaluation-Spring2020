# Connect-Four-AI-Algorithm-Evaluation-Spring2020
The Connect Four AI Project will create a basic bot for a user to play connect four against. The bot should make timely moves and not just randomly place pieces. Start with just brute force placement (with some input for placements) then move into algorithms such as the Minimax algorithm. The idea is to construct the code so that different algorithms can be evaluated for their performance. The net result will be a list of algorithms, why they were chosen, and how they performed against each other. The language restrictions are that you may not use java for the bot code itself. Java can be used for the user interface.
