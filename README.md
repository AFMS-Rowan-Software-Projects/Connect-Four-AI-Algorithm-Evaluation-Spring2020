# Connect-Four-AI-Algorithm-Evaluation-Spring2020
The Connect Four AI Project will create a basic bot for a user to play connect four against. The bot should make timely moves and not just randomly place pieces. Start with just brute force placement (with some input for placements) then move into algorithms such as the Minimax algorithm. The idea is to construct the code so that different algorithms can be evaluated for their performance. The net result will be a list of algorithms, why they were chosen, and how they performed against each other. The language restrictions are that you may not use java for the bot code itself. Java can be used for the user interface. 


In order to run this project: first load files into IDE of choosing, the team is currenlty using PyCharm. After loading files into PyCharm or the preferred IDE, Pygame must be installed. In order to do this, go to file, then settings, then project interpreter. On the right side of the window, there will be a plus(+) sign. press it. first, make sure you have the latest version of pip installed by searching for pip, clicking the first option, and hitting install. Then, search for pygame and do the same. After this, run the file UserInterface. The game should then run.
